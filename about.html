      <h2>About EduSync</h2>
      <p>
        EduSync is a web-based platform designed to help students and teachers manage<br>
        group projects effectively. Our mission is to make collaboration, task tracking,<br>
        and project management simple and intuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        With EduSync, teachers can assign projects, monitor progress, and review<br>
        submissions — while students can coordinate tasks, track milestones, and<br>
        submit their work easily. The platform encourages teamwork, accountability,<br>
        and smooth progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        EduSync aims to make group projects stress-free and organized, allowing every<br>
        team member to contribute efficiently toward success.
